       -v, --verbose
           Provide more detailed reports:

           count: the number of loose objects

           size: disk space consumed by loose objects, in KiB (unless -H is specified)

           in-pack: the number of in-pack objects

           size-pack: disk space consumed by the packs, in KiB (unless -H is specified)

           size-garbage: disk space consumed by garbage files, in KiB (unless -H is specified)

           alternate: absolute path of alternate object databases; may appear multiple times, one line per path. Note that if the path contains non-printable characters, it may be surrounded by double-quotes and
           contain C-style backslashed escape sequences.
